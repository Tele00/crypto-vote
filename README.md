# crypto-vote
**Crypto Vote** is a voting system that ensures the integrity of elections through blockchain and cryptographic methods.
It ensures:
1) Every voter is valid and eligible
2) Every voter can only vote once
3) Once a vote is casted it is impossible for it to be changed
4) Even if the details of a voter are known(name, id number e.t.c), It is impossible for an adversary/hacker to impersonate and vote on behalf of that voter
5) Makes sure each vote is validated using a proof of work before entering it intro the blockchain
6) The whole system is also zero-knowledge proof, so nobody can know who a particular voter voted for.


##To better understand the code, read through the comments in the **app.py** file and run the code to see how it works
##Feel free to download to the project and play around with app.py file. You can add new voters and vote, add new candidates e.t.c!
